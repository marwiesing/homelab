Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

sudo kubeadm join 192.168.0.100:6443 --token u6cul7.m0sjchh42mx6zyur \
	--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:72d25713808b6eb2ab05b386cb898700a95d3efd2c17512a4ae6b6153217a0ed

### **üîç Fixing Node Roles & Renaming Nodes in Kubernetes**  

Right now, your nodes show **no roles (`<none>`)**, and the names are incorrect (`debian`, `localhost.localdomain`, etc.).  

---

## **‚úÖ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Assign the Worker Role to Worker Nodes**  
By default, worker nodes don‚Äôt get a role assigned automatically. We need to **label them as `worker`** manually.

Run the following **on Ubuntu-1 (Control Plane):**  
```bash
kubectl label node ubuntu2 node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=worker
kubectl label node debian node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=worker
kubectl label node localhost.localdomain node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=worker
```
‚úÖ Now check:  
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
**Expected output:**  
```
NAME                    STATUS     ROLES           AGE     VERSION
debian-1                NotReady   worker          3m5s    v1.32.2
rocky-1                 NotReady   worker          87s     v1.32.2
ubuntu-1                Ready      control-plane   41m     v1.32.2
ubuntu-2                Ready      worker          5m27s   v1.32.2
```

---

## **‚úÖ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Rename Kubernetes Nodes Properly**  
Kubernetes **does not support renaming nodes directly**, so we need to **remove and rejoin** them with the correct name.

### **üîπ Step 1: Drain & Remove the Worker Nodes**  
Run the following **on Ubuntu-1 (Control Plane):**  
```bash
kubectl drain debian --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
kubectl drain localhost.localdomain --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
kubectl drain ubuntu2 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
```
Now remove them from Kubernetes:  
```bash
kubectl delete node debian
kubectl delete node localhost.localdomain
kubectl delete node ubuntu2
```

---

### **üîπ Step 2: Reset the Worker Nodes**  
Run this **on each worker node (debian, rocky, ubuntu-2):**  
```bash
sudo kubeadm reset -f
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname debian-1   # Change this on each worker node accordingly
sudo reboot
```
üìå **Repeat for each node, using the correct name:**  
- `debian-1`
- `rocky-1`
- `ubuntu-2`

---

### **üîπ Step 3: Rejoin the Workers with Correct Names**  
After the nodes reboot, **log back into each worker node** and rejoin Kubernetes:  
```bash
sudo kubeadm join 192.168.0.100:6443 --token u6cul7.xxx \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
_(Use the correct token and hash from your cluster.)_  

---

### **üîπ Step 4: Verify Everything is Correct**  
On Ubuntu-1 (Control Plane), check the nodes again:  
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
‚úÖ **Expected output (after a few minutes):**  
```
NAME        STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
ubuntu-1    Ready    control-plane   45m   v1.32.2
ubuntu-2    Ready    worker          3m    v1.32.2
rocky-1     Ready    worker          3m    v1.32.2
debian-1    Ready    worker          3m    v1.32.2
```

---

### **üéâ Done! Kubernetes Nodes Are Correctly Named & Labeled!**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Nodes have the correct names**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Workers are labeled as `worker`**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Cluster is now properly structured**  

üìå **Next Step:** Install **Helm (Kubernetes Package Manager) on Ubuntu-1**  
Let me know when you're ready! üöÄüî•
